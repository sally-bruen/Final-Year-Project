This folder has all the files used for my final year project. 

Each file begins with a number corresponding to what the program is aiming to do.

1 is for the program calculating the basic text statistics. The path to the vert folder and the output file path will need to be changed.

2 is for the program calculating TTR, WTR, CTTR and WDSEN. The input for this file is the .xlsx file outputted from program 1. The path to the file will need to be changed.

3 is for the programs calculating the the frequency with the wordlist. There is a seperate program for the Breacadh lists as they have different ranges to the NCI lists.
  These programs are split between types, tokens, words, content words, common nouns and proper nouns. In each program, the wordlist file path, vert folder path and output file path will need to be changed.

4 is for calculating the grade and accuracy of the previous programs. The input file paths will need to be changed for these files aswell as the output path. 
  '4 New Percentage Accuracy.py' should output a .xlsx file with all the values used and the range values I got to see the breakdown and will also output the percentage accuracy to the terminal in the IDE.
  To get results for this program you will need to run at least 1 program from 1-3 and use their paths as the 3 input files for this program.
