This folder has all the files used for my final year project. 

The Original Program folders contains the first version of the programs that are
used within the IDE.


The SeideanSi2.vert folder contains the .vert files for SS, TT and CT. This 
folder is needed to use the programs.


The Word Lists folder contains the 3 Breacadh word lists used and the NCI list in 
.xlsx format.


The Terminal folder contains all the programs made for this project that can be 
run from the terminal. These programs are labelled from 1 to 4.

1 is for the program calculating the basic text statistics. The vert folder is 
the input for these files and an output file in .xlsx format will need to 
specified in the terminal to use this program. 

2 is for the program calculating TTR, WTR, CTTR and WDSEN. The input for this 
file is the .xlsx file outputted from program 1, the path to this will need to be 
specified in the terminal as well as the path to the output .xlsx file.

3 is for the programs calculating the the frequency with the wordlists. There is 
a seperate program for the Breacadh lists as they have different ranges to the 
NCI lists.
These programs are split between types, tokens, words, content words, common 
nouns and proper nouns. For each program, the wordlist file path, vert folder 
path and output file path will need to be specified.

4 is for calculating the grade and accuracy of the previous programs. The input 
file paths will need to be changed for these files aswell as the output path. 
'4_New_Percentage_Accuracy.py' should output a .xlsx file with all the values 
used and the range values I got to see the breakdown and will also output the 
percentage accuracy to the terminal.
To get results for this program you will need to run at least 1 program from 1-3
and use their paths as the 3 input files for this program.
